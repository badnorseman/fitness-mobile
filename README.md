# Fitbird Application

## Getting Started

Requirements:
* You need to have Xcode 7.1+ installed
* node.js v4+ 
* `react-native-cli` should be installed globally, you can do so by running `npm -g install react-native-cli`

First you need to clone the repository, and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fitbird/app.git Fitbird
cd Fitbird
npm install
```

Then, to run the iOS app in a simulator or on a device, open the Xcode project. You can do this by browsing to `iOS/` and opening a file called `Fitbird.xcodeproj`, or by entering the following in the terminal:
`open iOS/Fitbird.xcodeproj`
